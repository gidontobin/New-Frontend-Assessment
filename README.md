# Hello from Handshaik


## Readme


We're super excited you're giving this a whirl. You are being given a repo that already has scaffolding and is nearly complete.

Aas you can see there is a left sidebar and right side bar.

We have already built the left side bar, you can find it in `/Users/coralfussman/Documents/Code/Frontend-Assesment/src/components/LeftSidebar.tsx` but it is not yet rendering to the UI

## You will be expected to do the following. 
- add any logic necessary to render the left sidebar provided in `/Users/coralfussman/Documents/Code/Frontend-Assesment/src/pages/Index.tsx` You will see a placeholder for the left and right sidebars
The left sidebar needs to be displayed on click of the Menu button in the Navbar

- You will also be expected to create the rightSidebar and add in any logic in order to render it. See image below. Try to get as close to the image as you can. It is open by clicking each table row and the table row data will be displayed on the right
